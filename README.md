## Running the tests

This classes havenÂ´t unit test

## Deployment


The process were building project maven with the command:

```
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=org.example -DartifactId=CALCULATOR -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false

```

Then we have verify the class App.java and the pom.xml, run the project with:

```
mvn package
```


For generate documentation update the pom.xml add and later use "mvn package":

```

## Architecture

Este proyecto tiene una arquitectura de 
This project is based on a REST API architecture where it consumes a service from the URL https://www.alphavantage.co/. The service sends a JSON file containing company data.

It's worth noting that a JavaScript client is created to consume the REST service created in Java, which in turn consumes the API. Additionally, there is a concurrent client from the `Concurrent` class in Java that consumes the REST service as depicted in the following image.

The following image shows the deployed service being consumed from AWS at the link:

It may not be running currently because the service closes upon disconnect. However the app is work.

## Extensibility

The project features an extensible design with a proposed interface so that when implemented in a new class, it can be modified and customized as needed for the service.
